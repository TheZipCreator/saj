Welp, here it is, my submission for Agma Schwa's Third Cursed Conlang Circus. This time I've created a language that I don't think is even comprehensible to human brains, or for that matter any intelligent species from our universe; that's right, this language has two dimensions of _time_ . While I've seen people explore the concept of higher spatial dimensions, I have never seen anyone explore higher temporal dimensions, and this conlang is in part my exploration into this idea. This topic is... really hard to explain so if you understood _any_ of this then I consider that a win.
